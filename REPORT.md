### Progress Report

Date: 2025-08-09

Scope: Web app only. Using Playwright to validate UI reachability and key controls while introducing TypeScript.

System: Windows (nvm-windows). Target legacy Node for CRA 2.

Actions completed
- Added `.nvmrc` (12.22.12)
- Added Playwright config + smoke tests
- Added `tsconfig.json` with incremental settings; enabled Node moduleResolution
- Converted a leaf component to TS: `MenuBarIconButton.tsx`
- Added type declarations for styles/assets under `types/globals.d.ts`

Commands recommended
- Start server (Terminal A):
  - `nvm use 12.22.12 && npm start`
- Run tests (Terminal B):
  - `npm run test:e2e` or `npm run test:e2e:headed`
- Type-check:
  - `npm run typecheck`

Notes
- Lockfile was older; prefer `npm install` once to sync after adding devDeps (TypeScript and types).
- Welcome modal is suppressed in tests via localStorage to avoid flakiness.

Runtime verification attempts
- Could not switch to Node 12 via nvm due to an nvm-windows install error when fetching npm ("The system cannot find the file specified" during npm zip extraction).
- Workaround to verify web UI now:
  - Terminal A (Node 12): Use any Node 12 installation you have (nvm or manual MSI). Start server with `npm start`.
  - Terminal B (Node 18 or current): `npx playwright install chromium` then `npm run test:e2e`.
  - Expected: tests load editor, canvas, timeline, and open settings modal.

Next steps
- Resolve Node 12 installation (nvm-windows): try running as Administrator, clearing TEMP/TMP, or temporarily disabling AV to allow npm zip extraction; then `nvm install 12.22.12` and `nvm use 12.22.12`.
- After server is up, run Playwright as above to complete Phase 1 verification.
